"""
This module provides async functionality for managing individual stopwords sets in Typesense.

Classes:
    - AsyncStopwordsSet: Handles async operations related to a specific stopwords set.

Methods:
    - __init__: Initializes the AsyncStopwordsSet object.
    - retrieve: Retrieves the details of this specific stopwords set.
    - delete: Deletes this specific stopwords set.
    - _endpoint_path: Constructs the API endpoint path for this specific stopwords set.

The AsyncStopwordsSet class interacts with the Typesense API to manage operations on a
specific stopwords set. It provides methods to retrieve and delete individual stopwords sets.

For more information regarding Stopwords, refer to the Stopwords [documentation]
(https://typesense.org/docs/27.0/api/stopwords.html).

This module uses type hinting and is compatible with Python 3.11+ as well as earlier
versions through the use of the typing_extensions library.
